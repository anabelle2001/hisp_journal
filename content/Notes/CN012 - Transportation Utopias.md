Pan americanism depended on travel, which depended on physical connectivity
- pan-american railway
- Pan-am airlines
- pan-american Highway
Sikorsky Amphibian Aircraft - S38

# Airlines
The areospace industry starts in World War II, and in peacetime the tech is re-configured for civilian use, such as Cargo, Passenger transit, and Scientific Exploration.

Juan Trigger 
- founder of panam (airline)
- Starts with one route (from florida?) to cuba

Panagra 
- Pan american grace airways
- poster - travel across landways

## Overview
Exploration performed by Charles lindbergh and A.V. Kidder. Charles Lindbergh is famous for being the first to fly across the atlantic ocean, and is also  interested in southwestern culture (AZ, CO, etc.). A.V. Kidder is famous from the Carnegie Institute

They flew over "Maya country" -- which is basically just Mexico & Guatemala -- to test a new airplane tech & find aincent mayan ruins:

> The greatest thrills of our five days' flying came, of course, from the finding of **hitherto unrecorded groups of Maya buildings indicating the presence of ancient cities**. But the purpose of the expedition was much more than the mere discovery of site; It was planned and carried out as **a test, a reconnaissance, to gauge the value of the aeroplane for survey and observation work**, and it proved that the plane is of unique usefulness in enabling one to study the country as a whole, to record its geography, to note the nature, distribution and extent of its forest types and to plan routes and fix landmarks for ground exploration. Finally, it is certain that the plane can in many region

## Group 3 - Page 197
We got the vibe that it was 
- very poetic
- connection: telegraph
- These articles show panamericanism through the perspective of technological development, with tech shrinking the time barrier dividing north and south america.

## Group 4. 199
They were struck by the Military Language:

> And so on the eighth we *struck* again

> In this way there were picked up Yaxha and Nakum, and by repeated low circling we taught ourselves this new technique of sky-spying.

## Group ???
It seems the goal is to exploit the land, to put people there

## Teacher
"Civilized" discovering the "uncharted"
Photographs and mapping - advantage of being above
the authroity of scientific discourse
This fits a broader theme of wanting to have fun by discovering aincent traditions
- Archeology
- Egyptology
- Indiana-Jones-core scientists 

"Uninhabited" - Where are the Mexican, Guatemalan People?
- Not really here. some are working on the ruins, Gov't officials
- Civilizations are in the past, Current indigenous groups are "Fallen" (195).


Purpose of the text is to construct narratives around indigenous land:
- Imposing logics of time - 3 minute trips, etc. etc.
- Examining Artifacts and declaring them ruins
- It doesn't really involve much communication with native populations
- Selling the idea of lam as exotic, uninhabited, full of adventure, lots to be gained by investing in this place. uses scientific language to legitimize himself, kindof like columus
