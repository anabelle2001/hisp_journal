# Columbus Review
## Reflection
I arrived about 4 mins late, we were in the middle of reviewing the reading from last night. One quote that came up in our group and another was the following:

> And they were the first to proclaim it wherever I arrived; and the others went running from house to house and to the neighboring villages, with loud cries of <u>“Come! come to see the people from Heaven!”</u> Then, as soon as their minds were reassured about us, ever

It's probably not even true - he doesn't speak the native language 

It's very much a narrative:
- First person, No line breaks, hard to skim
- Poetic & Hyperbolistic Language

## Class Discussion: <u>Rhetoric</u>
- Comparisons 
- Exaggerations
- Repetition
- Eyewitness Testimony
- Appeals to Authority
	- possibly also invoking authority

Other people made educated guesses that he's probably not in india, including Amerigo Vespucci
# Cannibalism
## Overview
> "An island is here in the approach to the Indies, which is inhabited by a people whom, in all the islands, they regard as very ferocious, who eat human flesh. " (270)

This is the only portion in *this letter* that mentions cannibalism. Everything else fits really nicely into the "Noble Savage" trope. This cannibal island, In the Spanish version, is called "Quaris", or "Carib". Etymologically, both "Caribbean" and "Cannibal" are descendants of the word Columbus used for the island. 

He never actually sees cannibalism, he only regurgitates secondhand accounts. He's initially ambivalent in his beliefs, but he eventually uses this rumor to construct a caricature of evil indigenous people. This rhetorical idea of the cannibal indian was used to justify enslaving some indigenous people. Instead of limiting slavery, this just made everyone think indians were cannibals
