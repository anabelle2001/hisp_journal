# Q1
## Question:
Our class is about travel. You describe yourself as a traveling historian / filmmaker.
## Answer:
A: ty for opportunity to talk. travel from ny to here.
1: as a historian, (grad school scholarship, call me seth), (film affected how i study history), history is a bunch of stories. history is less archeology (finding things), it's more architecture (building meaning, etc.). Film allowed me to do many thigns
1) tell more than one story at once

showing two things lets you see how contented truth is

hisotry happens between things; it's a dialouge between present and past. the past doesn't exist, it's something we create.
the vibe is like, our understanding of history is shaped by our present

flim gives you a more flexible way to talk about history - to show people

History has to be a credible story

## Vibes:
- history is storytelling. it's biased by our present. it's art we create
- film is more flexible than text

## Terms
what's a monograph

# Sequences Clip

SETH: 
This was done for kingy ny, a very prostegous institution. they have a tv station that shows short films, this is a shortened version of my full film. The version tonight is a newer version of the full film.

## Film is shown

## Discussion
Seth: 
I don't expect you to know who Robert Moses is, he was antidemocratic but built lots of infrastructure
I grew up in brooklyn, now live in queens: the home of the unisphere, moses's center of the new york empire. the crossroads connecting Long island, manhattan, etc.. The unisphere is symbolic, has no function, but is permanent; it's a monument to him.

# Student Question:
Seth:
I was making a film about radio controll cars, and at the end of filming each day, i'd go to the unisphere. i saw this beautiful light (this class is cool, i taught a history of the western hemisphere). But the unisphere symbolizes everything i taught about - the 60's space age capitalist optimsism. I could make a film about this - art about this. And then i saw the people in queens. people go to queens becsuae their countries weren't being uplifted in the way the US wanted to uplife other countries.

# My question
He was trying to say like, history involves synthesis, involves creating texts about the past, and there are artistic decisions that go into that text. 

He didn't say that like, that history can and should be analyzed as art, but he agrees with the statement.

He talked about the history as architecture metaphor - structural rigidity is academic rigour.
