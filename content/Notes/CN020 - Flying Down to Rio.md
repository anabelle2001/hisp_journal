Beligna is described as a "White Orchid", and is played by a white mexican actor, but is of a country that's mainly black

Her union with roger could be seen as a metaphor for US-Brazillian Relationships

This is 30 years untill interracial marriage is legalized nation-wide

The film works as a part of the "Informal Empire" of the us towards Latin America
Doesn't just represent US/LA rels, but wills it into existence
US achieves objectives not thru force, but through tech modernity, ingenuity, and goodwill
role of culture (music, film) in envisioning these political and economic alliances
Can be consumed by the movie-going masssses in the us = repr of la as friendly and galliant


LA bends to will of US
