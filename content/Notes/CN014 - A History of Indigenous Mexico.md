# Top Level

- The lecture drew on the speaker's book "Indigenous Autocracy", which came about about 2 months ago.


# Colonial: 1500's thru 1800's

- Pre-columbian population: 13-15m 
- Indigenous community was Religiously conquered, syncrotism


## Rights

While it's common today to conceptualize "rights" as guarntees made to all citizens, colonial mexico conceptualized rights as coming from communities. For white settlers, this could be the church, for native indians, it would be the república de indios.

Independence:
- RDI abolished, 
- Same laws for everyone

"Ley Lerlo"
- aboloshes "corporate privledges",
- Previously, privledges/rights/access to land could be distributed to members of an organzation
- EG: privledges extended to churchmembers, indigenous groups who share stuff communally
- Goal: liberalize mexico, guarentee property rights

Benito Juárez (1806-1872) of Ojaca
- Indian, Zapotech, Very Educated, Lawyer
- Pushed for "Ley Lerlo" and other laws that hurt the indigenous community
- seems to be liked by others

Porfito Díaz (1830-1915)
- "George Washington" of mexico
- Economic Development
- Modernize Mexico Economically & Culturally
- Simletaneously, construct idea of mexico as traditional, historic.
  - Pyramids in world fair
  - Compares Aztecs to Romans

General Development
- Railroads built (with british funds, for economic development purposes)
- Chicago World Fair, "República Mexicana" Exhibit

Próspero Cahuantzi (1885 - 1911)
- racially indigenous (Tlaxcala), not seen as white
- "Huate" - close military bro
- Helped Conquistadors overthrow aztecs so they could install him as governer of Tlaxcala, México
- One of the *few* people who was born in the state that he ruled in
- Seen as loyal to (Díaz?)

"A selective conciliaiton of demands"
- Cahuantzi micromanages water & agrarian conflicts, balancing native Tlaxcalians' unrest w/ what he needed to do to stay in power

# Revolución! 1917

New constitution
- in theory helps indigenous populations, but in general, doesn't.

Zapatistas
- Because we are indigenous, we deserve certain rights

What do we do?

Indigenous people are not a monolith
- Some want to do what we all do, going to college, doing a carrer, etc.
- Some want land back
- Some want rights through corporate privledges
- Some want rights through the state, as citizens.

# Questions

## PRI

PRI was good at appropriating indigenous stuff to assimilate people. 

But also, it was kindof just "Let's lift up the poor and offer 

- education
- work opportunities
- division of land

Zapatistas responded to this by saying "no, it's not just about class, what are you going to do about us indians"


Bad Indian - Problems that american indigenous people suffer
