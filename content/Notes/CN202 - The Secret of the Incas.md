Charachter     | Description
---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Harry Steele   | handler/hustler, opportunistic local. 
                 "i'm gonna take your bags, pay me, i'll show you the sites" |

Ed Morgan      | frenemies with steele
                 has a fancy stone that shows you the path to a sunburst |

Elena          | Romainian girl, trying to get to peru or something |

## How is indigenetiy represented?
- They do use indigenous people, but only as extras
- Not costumed, used legitimate costumes
- Don't have a lot of lines
- Voiceless, expressionless, massless.
- No collaboration, peru is just a setting
The exception, of course, is Yma Sumac:

## Is it panamericanist?
There isn't really a sense of Pan-americanism or "good neighbors"; they're adventuring, extracting, and fleeing Peru. They do speak Spanish, Ketchuan, but they are using it to try and leave Peru. We do get to see the seedy underbelly of tourism, though.

## How can we read the Steel/Elena relationships in the context of the cold war?
- Steel leaves the sunburst to get Elena
- US trying to court eastern bloc nations - Romaina under soviet influence, but is trying to assert more independence.
- Latin America is less of a focus now that conflicts are taking place elsewhere.

## Quotes?
1. "Not much to see. Native Dances, maybe, if you're interested"
2. "We won't see anyone there. few indians, maybe" 
3. "Nobody comes here without a reason. the only reason is to dig."
4. "Maybe i've already found something to take its \[the sunburst's\] place."
