# Walt Disney goes to Latin America
Documentary: Walt Disney and "El Grupo", avaible on disney +

In 1941, FDR and Nelson Rockefeller asked Walt Disney to go to Latin America, mainly to serve as a "good neigbor" ambassador to counter Nazi influence in the region. For Disney, latin america offered inspiration via cultural influence, and allowed them to get away from the ongoing hollywood strike

It was a very successful trip, partially because latin ameirca already loved disney's work, partially because disney really engaged with the local culture and local actors. It resulted in two movies: Saludos Amigos (1942) & The Three Caballeros (1944). Both are Vignette Stories (meaning they're anthological)

# WWII
Latin americans were already in the us!!

Re: Oppenheimer: New-Mexicans in Los Alamos region worked under oppenhiemer in the atomic bomb projects, and suffered from radioactive fallout. These people were nowhere in the film, which painted the area as remote and uninhabited. 

Re Borders: Donald Duck, Goofy easily go back and forht, but Pantito Pistola doesn't come up. Foreigners in the us are no longer friendly, don't deserve to be seen. 


# Homegrown Analysis

## Representation 
– how are Latin American subjects represented, and how does this fit (or does not fit) within the Good Neighbor Policy?

They're represented as like, a beautiful foreign culture not to be colonized, but to be experienced.

## Collaboration 
– how do local Latin American actors and technical staff participate in the making of these films? Why is this significant in the context of good Neighbor?

There's a lot of Lam dancers, and it stars voice actors from brazil and Mexico. 

## Reception 
– what may be the intended reception of these films? Who are they aimed at? Is their visual language convincing?

I think it's intended to just create all-around positive vibes around latin america - to get people to know some pop culture facts (like, how someone coming to the US might find out about walmart / Wall Street / New York). I found it to be effective (and affective) propoganda. 

## Connection 
– What connections can you draw to class topics?
