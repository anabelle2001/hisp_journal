# Jose & Elihu
José Romeu, Foreign Affairs in Uruguay, spoke in spanish
Elija Roots, ????, spoke in english

> [! danger | right]
> an inert mineral is stealing the valour of columbian labour unions
## Tone, General:
Diplomatic, common ground

## Vibes, General:
Very snobby, banquety, historical

## Themes, Opening Scene
Distance, communicatoin tech, hospitality


> In spite of ... momentos, tounge, customs, sentiments, and traditions which the evolutions of the human spirit do not easily obliterate

he's arguing that there's some things that latin america will hold that's different from USA

>That assertion ... ordered liberty

Spanish colonialism is bad, but rejecting colonialism outright is bad.

## In both their speeches
Frendship, Fraternaty

History starting in the colonial era: ¶4,6
- erases indigeneity

Civilization
- Whiteness
- European / latin classicism
- "The People"

# Conlcusion
panam was a discourse of lam elites, for whome panam iws a strategy for creating political, econ, and cultural ilainces w the world's richest nations. grounded on westernciv and erasing indigeneith and blackness
highly performative speeches - language as a way of reifiing cooperaiton and friendship

ignores reality (current conflicts, us imperialism of cuba) in the name of strategic positioning
