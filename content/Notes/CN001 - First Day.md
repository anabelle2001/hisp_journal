## Class Discussion
We generally learn about Latin America in three main areas:
1. Spanish language classes
	- Are generally focused on Spain, as most spanish classes were founded by / influenced by the RAE (Real Academia Espa√±a)
	- Cover grammar, communication, and non-controversial cultural topics
2. History classes
	- In US History, Latin America is covered through the perspective of International Relations. Namely, war and crises with mexico.
	- In World History, Latin america is covered as a part of a broader category, such as communism.
3. REI COURSES
	* Latin America is covered as a group of "Third World" countries

We were then shown a slide of Coco, Encanto, Drugs, and soldiers
