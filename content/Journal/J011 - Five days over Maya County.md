# Prompt
Charles Lindbergh was the first person to cross the Atlantic ocean by plane in 1927, and because of this became a celebrity in the US. In 1930, he and his wife Anne Morrow joined the archeologist Alfred V. Kidder in his trip over Central America. They flew in the amphibian Sigorsky airplane. Use your map to help you read, to understand where Kidder and the Lindberghs are traveling.Â 

For your reflection, consider:
- What kind of trip is this? What kind of publication do you think Scientific Monthly is?
- What does Kidder focus on in his narrative? What are some words that catch your attention, and why?
- What is the role of the images that accompany the test?
# Reflection

It seems that the goal of the trip was to document ancient Mayan civilizations in Latin america, and how the latest technology allowed Kidder to explore them. Not only is there a huge focus on how the machines shrink down travel times, the article also talks about these technological developments using military language. The role of the images seems relatively straightforward, it seems they're there to is to try and get people excited about Mayan civilizations, and the new technologies that will allow for further exploration.
