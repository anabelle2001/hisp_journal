# Reflection
I had heard a lot about the panthers outside of this classroom, but i still learned quite a bit from the film. I was honestly most suprised by the film's depiction of the panthers' class solidarity; I had always seen the org as promoting black power, but seeing them team up with the Young Lords and Young Patriots made me question that assumption.
