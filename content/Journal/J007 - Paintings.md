# Prompt
Write a brief reflection about two images.Â 
- What do these engravings represent, related to Wednesday's discussion?
- How do they relate to Columbus's letter?
- How can we interpret their visual language?

# Reflection
These paintings depict indigenous Americans as savages. In the first picture, the Indians' bodies are painstakingly rendered, with shading used to emphasize the sharp changes in curvature where their muscles bulge out. The second picture depicts a group of Indians and animals brawling on the ground while a group of colonizers, standing above and away from them, observe with fascination. In the last two pictures, the native Americans are shown in a small village with straw houses. In these rural environments, they're shown engaging in vivid acts of cannibalism and torture. these drawings were illustrated Theodore De Bry, a 16th century Belgian illustrator. Instead of going to america, he read Columbus's letter and just drew these as concept art for interactions between Columbus and the native Americans. A lot of the visual language of these paintings seems to be borrowed from Hellenistic Greek sculpture. the indigenous people are drawn contrapaso, with wavy hair and well-defined muscles reminiscent of sculptures from the period.
