1. Think about the words he uses to describe the Indies. 
	- How and why does he do it this way?
	- What words does he use?
	- What is his objective?
	- How does he depict himself?
2. Pick 2-3 citations that you would like to discuss in class
	- Use these questions as a starting point for writing a brief reflection (around 15 sentences)
	- And remember that, when reading a text that you might already know (or have some previous information about) be mindful to read very carefully, and not let what you already know occlude what's in the actual text
# Reflection

As a writer, I hated the way that Columbus wrote this letter. Not only does he spend dozens of lines sucking up to the king & queen of Spain, he doesn't even format his letter into discrete blocks / paragraphs. If the goal is to communicate facts about the new world, this stream of consciousness-style message feels very ineffective. I don't understand why he'd write it this way, especially knowing that the recipient is essentially just a cabinet member of the Spanish government, and it's even more confusing knowing that this got translated into latin, German, italian, and ultimatley english.
He does do a good job of making the case for further voyages, though, and uses a really poetic description of the natural resources: 
> There are wonderful pine-groves, and very large plains of verdure, and there is honey, and many kinds of birds, and many various fruits.
> p. 264

Beyond that, i find the localization of "Española" into Hispanola to be interesting. It's almost like it's an english orthograthization of the original pronunciation, which is fascinating because i never realized that Hispanola was a calque of Española.
