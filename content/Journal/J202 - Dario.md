# Reflection
I did not expect  *To Rosevelt* and *Saluting the Eagle* to have such radically different stances on America. While *Roosevelt* is a strong condemnation of the colonialism exceptionalism and interventionalism, *Saluting the Eagle* feels more like a love letter. 

This disconnect really gets at the heart of my own mental model of the US. Growing up, I was told that we were a nation of immigrants that prided itself on values like free speech and democracy. But learning actual american history. But when i got older, that bubble popped, and i came to understand that we were a country of colonialism, war profiteering, corporate lobbying, and more.

What's fascinating to me is that 

sonance For me, the tension between these two texts highlights a completley different tone; it's much more focused on 
 
  military machine.
 
  but then, in saluting the eagle, he pivots and talks about the
 
  idea of america as a, like, utopian immigrant place.
  i think, for me.
  i noticed that tension in my own beliefs about america.
  and so it's interesting to see someone from another culture, really identify those beliefs have shifting narrative about them.
