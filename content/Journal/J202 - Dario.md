# Reflection

I did not expect  *To Rosevelt* and *Saluting the Eagle* to have such radically different stances on America. While *Roosevelt* is a strong condemnation of the colonialism exceptionalism and interventionalism, *Saluting the Eagle* feels more like a love letter. 

This disconnect really gets at the heart of my own mental model of the US. Growing up, I was told that we were a nation of immigrants that prided itself on values like free speech and democracy. But learning actual american history. But when i got older, that bubble popped, and i came to understand that we were a country of colonialism, war profiteering, corporate lobbying, and more. It feels strange knowing that *Saluting the Eagle* came after *To Rosevelt*. I don't really know what to make of the fact that Dario started as a critic of the USA, only to later fall in love with it.
