Read the entire article. Write a 2.0-3.0 page reflection (TNR 12pt, DS) , addressing the following information

- Paragraph 1: main ideas, structure, sources
    - What is this articleâ€™s ==main argument==? Explain it in your own words.
    - How is this article structured? What are its sections, and how does its ==organization== contribute to making its arguments clear?
    - What ==primary sources== does it use? How does it analyze them?

- Paragraph 2: connections
    - What were one or two things you found most interesting or relevant? Discuss them briefly.
    - What are some connections to the class themes? Discuss one-two concrete things.
    - Include 2-3 quotes from the text to support your points in this paragraph.

  

Remember: I am not interested in a summary of every point of the article (that would be too long), but rather on your understanding of its broad ideas and the potential connections to class topics such as Pan Americanism, friendship, diplomacy or the power of language. The point of this exercise is to practice reading secondary sources, finding its key arguments and explaining them succinctly.
