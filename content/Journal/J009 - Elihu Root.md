# Assignment
Elihu Root, Secretary of State under Teddy Roosevelt, designed and implemented the **Platt Amendment**, which increased US control over *Cuba* by permitting more US involvement in the island and limiting other foreign intervention. Root was the first Secretary of State to travel outside the US on official business. He traveled to Uruguay on the 10-12 of August, 1906, where he was warmly received by the President and his cabinet members. Root's involvement in the region expanded US-Latin American relations. This text is a transcription of the speeches given by Foreign Affairs Secretary José Romeu welcoming Root to the River Plate region, and Root's response. 

Guide questions for the speeches. Remember to write your reflection in your notebook homework. 

- How (and where) does Romeu's speech begin?
- What is the tone of these speeches?
- What are some of the most recurring words used?
- How do they paint the relationship between the US and Uruguay (and Latin America more broadly)?
- What are some of the difficulties that Romeu finds in this relationship, and how are they being overcome?

# Reflection

Romeu starts by talking about the USS Charleston entering the port of Rio. He's suprisingly fraternal; he talks about US/Latin american relationships within the context of friendship, and waxes poetically about how increased communication and transportation can overcome the geospatial barriers that are stopping US/Latin american relationships. I was fairly suprised that Root responds by encouraging latin american sovereignty, saying  "I am here to learn more, and also to demonstrate our belief in the substantial similarity of interests and sympathies of the American self-governing republics".
