# Draft / Reflection

I like this text. It seems to discuss the various panamericanist propaganda pieces funded by the OCCCR/OIAA, why they were commissioned, and whether they were effective. I think Richard Smith's overall thesis in this chapter could be summarized in a sentence: during the second world war, the federal government and American industry worked together to fund artists in south america, thinking that such art would encourage panamericanist sentiment at home, and ultimately help the allies win the war. The text's structure is fairly uniform. It opens by discussing the founding of OCCCR/OIAA, and the perceived tactical & logistical consequences of loosing Brazil to the axis. Then, it talks about the artistic choices used to warm american sentiment towards brazillians. Richard Smith explains these decisions by showing the reader the relevant art, and occasionally works that may have inspired it. On page 118, for example, Smith compares the visual conventions of Genevieve Naylor's photographs of Brazil to the the visual conventions of art produced during the great depression. In both cases, Smith argues, photographed subjects are portrayed as hard-working individuals who are temporarily denied opportunity due to extraordinary circumstances. To support this claim, he shows *Lumber Worker and his Wife* - a photo from the depression - directly across from *Men by Favela Restaurant*, and then describes the similarities between the two in the first full paragraph below the latter (118-120).

One of the lines that really stood out to me was on page 117. Richard Smith is talking about Genevieve Naylor's photography of working class people, and makes an off-hand comment that "Influencing public opinion in Latin America was an important objective, but shaping public opinion in the United States had greater priority". I found this claim really suprising; I've seen lots of american propoganda from WWII, but the examples were always hand-drawn posters encouraging people to buy war bonds, carpool, or make gardens. These photos don't have that optimism; they feel almost depressing.
