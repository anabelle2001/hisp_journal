## Timestamped Notes from Movie

It starts showing People in military-like dress, next to fancy flight-attendant-like girls, all at a hotel in Miami, FL.
Jump cut to two people arriving from a plane and sprinting to Conduct / MC an orchestra for a ballroom dance

In the ballroom, a brazilian secudtress named beligna is dressed in very floofy white gown, she tells her friend group that she's going to (flirt with?) the orchestral conductor, and then takes him for a dance. 

( ~ 10 mins in)

the man is sort of, shown as an object of her desire, being pulled to her despite the risk it carries for his career. their performance seemingly gets them a gig in rio, and the white-haird man ends up fling Beligna to rio when, upon bumping into her at the telegram station, he realizes that she missed her flight.

Her Telegram:
> Carter du Resendo
> Hotel atlantico - 
> Rio De Janerio -- 
> Father dear sorry you are ill we missed this week's rio plane taking next love to julio"

( ~ 20 mins in)

They crash on an island, and both have a angel-devil moment where they're deciding whether to take advantage of their predicament for romantic purposes

"Isn't it silly how humans deny themselves the things they want most"
"To satisfy a stupid convention. But we can speak the truth! I can say I love you"

"I'm going to institute some radical changes in your country"

It feels like the white-haired conductor's romantic desire to free this girl from her repressive, backward family maps cleanly onto the US desire to colonize the region.

he also responds to her slapping him once by throwing her over and spanking her five times

(30)
They wake up to meet "cannibals" - they're actually black cabbies in port-au-prince golf club - she takes a commerical plane to rio de janeor

(35)
The white haired guy is roger
He stays at the port-au-prince hotel, and meets a "Julio", and talks to him about what they did when he crashed.

he called beligna "A poor defenseless child in a babie buggie"

(40)
"distinguished visitors from our sister continent, north america"

they're still dancing. not much plot-wise has happened

(52)

"Greeks want to take the hotel over"

(70)
They find out that the hotel's "entertainment liscence" is suspended, and have to cancel practice

(77)
"Hotel Atlantico presents yankee clipper" wroitten in the sky
Girls are on the wings of the biplanes doing Areobatics.

"We belong to our families, and our promises, even though all we want in the world is beautiful, crazy happyness"

## ==Reflection==
### Representation 
> how are Latin American subjects represented, and how does this fit (or does not fit) within the Good Neighbor Policy?


It's hard to generalize, but belinda, the main female role, is presented as a young and beautiful bride. She flirts with the american protagonist, but spends the runtime of the movie running into obstacles of "tradition" that prevent her from running free with him. 

### Collaboration
> how do local Latin American actors and technical staff participate in the making of these films? Why is this significant in the context of good Neighbor?

This question is hard to answer because I didn't really see anything in the text that would hint about the composition of the cast/crew. I'm going to see what we talk about in class, and write that down in my notes.

### Reception
> what may be the intended reception of these films? Who are they aimed at? Is their visual language convincing?

I kindof see the male leads as personifying the same sterotype that my grandfather did. He died in the 70's, i think? but from my late grandmother, i know he was an ex air-force pilot who traveled the world & was a kind-of rennisance-man. I think being an american vet gave him this authority of being from a higher class, and the male lead's confidence kindof gives me those vibes.

I think they're trying to appeal to US Men by letting them vicariously indulge in a romantic power fantasy? That was the vibe i got from the scene where they were stuck on the island together, but for all i know that could just be how relationships were in the 30's. 

To reiterate from the notes above, It feels like the male lead's romantic desire to free this girl from her repressive, backward family can be mapped onto the US desire to modernize & exploit the region. But honestly, the whole movie is too alien for me to say anything with confidence.

### Connection
> – What connections can you draw to class topics?

this movie has a wierd fascination with airplanes
- The couple first share a private room by getting on an airplane together, and then the crash brings them together for a night.
- The finale dance scene seems to have airplanes shoehorned in; they don't really show people looking at the dancers on the airplanes from afar, and it's not clear why having dancers on airplanes would allow people to perform music in the dining area.
- The couple literally marries on the airplane, using it to escape the traditional rules around marriage waiting periods.

## ==Reflection==
### Representation 
– how are Latin American subjects represented, and how does this fit (or does not fit) within the Good Neighbor Policy?

They're represented as like, a beautiful foreign culture not to be colonized, but to be experienced.

### Collaboration 
– how do local Latin American actors and technical staff participate in the making of these films? Why is this significant in the context of good Neighbor?

There's a lot of Lam dancers, and it stars voice actors from brazil and Mexico. 

### Reception 
– what may be the intended reception of these films? Who are they aimed at? Is their visual language convincing?

I think it's intended to just create all-around positive vibes around latin america - to get people to know some pop culture facts (like, how someone coming to the US might find out about walmart / Wall Street / New York). I found it to be effective (and affective) propoganda.
