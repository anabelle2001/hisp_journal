For Friday. Only need to read pages 652-655, Mistral's remarks at the conference. But entire text available for context. 

Text is a bit abstract, so don't worry if you don't understand everything. Keep in mind the following questions to help you navigate it and respond to the homework prompt. 

- What is the tone of her speech? How does she envision the relationship between the US and Latin America? How does it compare to Martí or Darío's positions?
- On page 653, she talks about "the Indian essence". What is this, and what does she say about it?
- What does she mean by "dissimilarity without inferiority"? 
- What role does religion play in this text?

For homework, choose one quote that captures the meaning of the text and comment how it reveal's Mistral's broader arguments. Quote + 5-6 sentences of explanation.
